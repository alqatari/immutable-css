# immutable-css [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/johnotander/immutable-css.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/johnotander/immutable-css)

Best practices suggest avoiding overriding styles from vendor libraries to prevent unwanted side effects. Base library styles should not be altered â€“ or as Harry Roberts describes, base styles should be treated as [Immutable CSS](http://csswizardry.com/2015/03/immutable-css/).

## Installation

```bash
npm install --save immutable-css
```

## Usage

```js
var immutableCss = require('immutable-css')

immutableCss('vendor.css', 'app.css')
// [{ selector: '.awesome', line: 5, column: 1, rule: {/* Rule Object */} }];
```

```js
immutableCss('vendor.css', 'app.css', { verbose: true })
// app.css[line 5,col 1]: .awesome was mutated
```

### Options

* `ignoredClasses` (Array): List of classes to ignore for mutation violations. Ex: `['.some-mutable-class']`
* `immutableClasses` (Array): List of classes to check against. Ex: `['.button', '.foobar']`
* `immutablePrefixes` (Array): List of prefix regexes that are immutable. Ex: `[/\.u\-/, /\.util\-/]`

### Using the CLI

```
npm i -g immutable-css
```

```
immutable-css vendor.css app.css app2.css

test/fixtures/app.css
test/fixtures/app.css[line 5,col 1]: .awesome was mutated
test/fixtures/app.css[line 9,col 1]: .awesome was mutated
test/fixtures/app.css[line 13,col 1]: .foo was mutated
test/fixtures/app.css[line 17,col 1]: .awesome was mutated
test/fixtures/app.css[line 21,col 1]: .awesome was mutated
test/fixtures/app2.css
test/fixtures/app2.css[line 1,col 1]: .foo was mutated
```

The CLI exits with an error code if there are mutations, too. That way you can include the CLI as part of your CI:

```
some_ci_stuff && immutablecss vendor.css app.css && other_ci_stuff
```
